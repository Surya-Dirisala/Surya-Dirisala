Something about me👨‍💻


Hey pals! I'm Surya, a passionate individual with a diverse set of interests ranging from VLSI design, writing, lyricism to dipping my toes into the world of coding. 

VLSI Enthusiast 💡

VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) has always intrigued me with its intricate designs and the magic of miniaturization. Exploring the depths of chip design and understanding how electronic systems work at the fundamental level is a fascinating journey I'm committed to. 🔬

Writer and Lyricist ✍️

When I'm not diving into the technical intricacies of VLSI or coding, you'll likely find me lost in the realm of words. I have a profound love for writing and lyricism. Crafting stories, poems, and songs allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in ways that transcend conventional boundaries. 📝

Beginner Level Coder 💻

While I'm still at the beginner level in coding, I'm eager to learn and grow in this field.  🌱

Quest for Knowledge 🔍

VLSI and Embedded Domains 🛠️

My interest in VLSI extends beyond mere fascination; it's a field where I see endless possibilities. Exploring embedded systems and understanding how hardware and software interact at the micro level is a quest I'm determined to pursue. 🤖

Machine Learning 🤖

Machine Learning represents the convergence of my interests in technology and creativity. The idea of teaching machines to learn and make decisions fascinates me. It's a challenging yet rewarding quest that I'm eager to conquer, leveraging its potential to innovate and solve real-world problems. 🧠
